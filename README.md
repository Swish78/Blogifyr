# Blogifyr
My blogging platform is a simple and secure web app built with Python, Flask, and MySQL. Users can create, manage, and categorize their own posts, read and comment on others' posts, and search for content by keyword or tag.

I chose Flask as the web framework for my blogging platform.
I designed the database schema using MySQL Workbench to create the necessary tables and columns to store information such as blog posts, comments, user information, and any other relevant data.
I built the data models using SQLAlchemy to define the structure of my data and how it would be stored in the database.
I created views, which were Python functions that handled HTTP requests from the user's browser and returned responses.
I defined templates, which were HTML files that defined the layout and structure of my web pages.
I implemented user authentication using the Flask-Login library to allow users to create and manage their own blog posts.
Finally, I tested my application to make sure it worked correctly, and then deployed it to a web server or a cloud-based platform like Heroku.
